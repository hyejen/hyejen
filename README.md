my name is emma and i’m an scandinavian high school art studentl, hoping to one day land a job within the game / art industry. i’m currently working on learning game design / developing , programming (c++, HTML, CSS, digital art, pixel art, animation, and 3d modeling.

in my spare time i enjoy spending time with my two cats, and staying up late. i have a special place in my heart for old web graphics, otters, platform shoes, and putting on huge eyeliner
